# Image Compression using K-Means Algorithm  
>Using K-Means for Color Quantization  
  
## Usage
To compress your own image use-
```bash
$python compressor.py ((path to image))
```
  
## Image before Compression  
<img src="violet_evergreen.jpg" width="400"/>  
  
## Image after Compression
<img src="violet_evergreen_compressed.jpeg" width="400"/>  
  
## Conclusion  
The size of the image remains the same and sharpness of the image is maintained reasonably well thus this is a great method for image compression.
